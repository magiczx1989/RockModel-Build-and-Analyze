The main methods include the bipahsic change on RF, morphological opening and geodesic reconstruction. The program is written in the C++ language.

"BiphasicChange‚Äù is applied to change a continuous RF to a two-phase field. RF is able to be generated via different methods.

"MorphologicalOpening" is applied to erase small components ( smaller than the definded size of structural element).

"Transfer" is based on the operation of geodesic reconstruction, to detect potential transfer paths between two opposite faces.
